Command line message bot for Discord.

## What is this ##
This is a Discord bot that allows you to pass simple commands to be sent to a discord server.<br>

## Why? ##
Well I have probably way to many automated tasks and programs going on and I want those programs to send me simple reports on when they are done or if they need attention.<br>
Giving every program there own discord bot is kinda stupid, so lets make one central bot that all the programs can use.
